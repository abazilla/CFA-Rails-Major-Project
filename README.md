# About
Open Education is a platform for NSW Schools and Teachers to be able to share their curriculum, lesson planning, and resources amongst each other.

This is a project created by myself as part of the Coder Factory Academy bootcamp. The goal was to fully ideate, design, plan, build, test and deploy a rails application from start to finish, using the skills learned in previous weeks.
